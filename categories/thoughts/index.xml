Curently I am focusing on philosophy(mainly descriptive), logic(the main tool) and mathematics(a more pragmatic branch of logic that helps me in everyday life).
I feel that the sharper my tools will be, the more I could spot logical fallacies or inconsistencies, which in turn will make me lose appreciation in everyday events. If I spot multiple inconsistencies in a movie&amp;rsquo;s script, although it was highly entertaining, the movie is bad.</description></item></channel></rss>
