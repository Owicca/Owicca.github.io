      <description>17/03:  conectiunea intre doua layere diferite se face prin straight cable tipuri de porturi vlan:  access vlan   tipuri vlan:  user vlan(any kind of traffic) default vlan(always vlan1; can&amp;rsquo;t be renamed or deleted) management vlan(interfata cu ip pentru remote management) voice vlan(for voip) native vlan(frames will be forced to be 802.3 instead of 802.1Q)   cate un port pentru fiecare vlan(porturi access) presupune si cate un cablu/port pentru fiecare vlan(ramanem repede fara porturi libere;dezavantaj) frame ethernet 802.</description>

      <description>ch1 internetworking:  Chapter concepts  Infrastructure components:  firewalls access points wireless controllers   Networking topologies:  star mesh hybrid     What is an internetwork:  two or more networks connected via a router and configured with a logical network addressing scheme with a protocol such as ip or ipv6   network segmentation:  use switches to segment each sw interface into a separate collision domain hubs connect network segments routers break up a broadcast domain   network broadcast:  every device on the network must read and process the broadcast, unless its a router   collision domain:  a device sends a packet out on a network segment and every other device is forced to pay attention no matter what if two devices try to send packets at the same time, a collision occurs and they need to retransmit the packet sequentially   devices:  routers:  break up broadcast domains break up collision domains don&amp;rsquo;t forward broadcasts by default can filter the net based on layer 3(network layer) ip address(logical addressing) packet switching packet filtering:  via access lists   internetwork communication:  connect two or more networks together   path selection:  uses a routing table to map networks to paths   L3 switches provide connection between virtual lans(vlans) can provide quality of service(QOS) for specific types of network traffic it only cares where a network is located and how to get to it   switches:  forward and filter frames L2 switches optimize LAN performance does not break up domains by default switch frames from a port to another withing a switched network each port is a different collision domain in a switched network, you still need a router to provide communication between VLANS it only cares about uniquelly identifying a lan device   wlan device(wireless nic) access points:  extend a collision domain they are in their own broadcast domain(vlan)   firewalls:  controll incoming and outgoing net traffic they are usually an ips(intrusion protection system)     common lan traffic congestion reasons:  too many hosts in a collision or broadcast domain broadcast storms too much multicast traffic low bandwidth adding hubs for connectivity to the network a bunch of arp broadcasts    Communication modes:  simplex: one-way communication(say something and not get a reply) half-duplex: two-way communication(receiver has to wait for the sender to finish sending the message, then it can send a response back) full-duplex: two-way communication(devices receive and transmit at the same time)  Communication types:  connection-oriented:  caracteristics:  virtual circuit(three-way handshake) uses sequencing uses acknowledgments uses flow control   steps:  first establish a connection-oriented session with a &amp;ldquo;three-way handshake&amp;rdquo;:  segment from sender to receiver to request for synchronization(SYN) segment from receiver to sender to acknowledge(ACK) the request and establish connection parameters segment from sender to receiver to acknowledge(ACK) that the connection agreement has been accepted and the actual connection has been established   transfer data termination call that tears down the virtual circuit      Flow control: (provide a way for the receiver to control the amount of data sent by the sender)</description>
