							<span class="year">3rd Mar 1845
							</span>	|	
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor" target="_blank">Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor
							</a>
							was born on March 3, 1845 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Cantor was brought up as a staunch Protestant and inherited the love for the arts from his parents.</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1856
							</span>	|	Cantor had a private tutor from a very young age and attended primary school in St. Petersburg.When Cantor was 11 years old, his family moved to Germany, although Cantor was never at ease in this country.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1860
							</span>	|	He proved to be a brilliant student and graduated with distinction from the Realschule in Darmstadt in 1860.
							<span class="info">He was exceptionally good at mathematics, particularly trigonometry
							</span>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1862 To 1863
							</span> 	|	He entered the University of Zürich in 1862. Meanwhile his father died and left him a substantial inheritance. So, the young Cantor shifted to the University of Berlin in 1863. There he specialized in physics, philosophy, and mathematics.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1866 To 1867
							</span>	|	He then proceeded to spend a semester at the University of Göttingen in 1866 and wrote his 
							<span class="info">doctoral thesis
							</span> in 1867.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1869 To 1879
							</span>	|	Georg Cantor began his career by teaching in a Berlin girls’ school for a brief period of time. He then accepted a position at the University of Halle, where he spent his entire career.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1869 To 1873
							</span>	| 	He published a series of ten papers from 1869 to 1873 in which he dealt with the 
							<span class="info">theory of numbers
							</span>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1874
							</span>	|	He began his work on what became known as set theory in 1874.
							<br/>He published an article ‘On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers’ which marked the beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics. The article provided a rigorous proof that there was more than one kind of infinity. Through this work he proved that real numbers are not countable.Georg Cantor married Vally Guttmann in 1874. It was a happy marriage and they had six children.
						</li>
						<img class="aleph" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Aleph0.svg/565px-Aleph0.svg.png" target="_blank"/>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1879 To 1884
							</span>	|	Extending his research, he published a series of six articles in ‘Mathematische Annalen’ between 1879 and 1884 that formed an introduction to his set theory. He also introduced the Cantor set during this period. During this time he faced severe criticism of his works which is believed to have affected his mental health even though he continued his mathematical work despite the criticism.</li>
						<li><span class="year">1891
							</span>	|	In 1891, he published a paper containing his "diagonal argument" for the existence of an uncountable set. He applied the same idea to prove what is now known as 
							<span class="info">Cantor's theorem
							</span>. The theorem states that, 
							<span class="info">for any set A, the set of all subsets of A has a strictly greater cardinality than A itself.
							</span></li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1895 To 1897
							</span>	|	By this time his mental health had begun to deteriorate though he still determinedly performed mathematical research. His last significant papers on set theory were published in 1895 and 1897 in ‘Mathematische Annalen’ under Felix Klein's editorship.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">1904
							</span>	|	The Royal Society awarded Cantor its Sylvester Medal, the highest honor it can confer for work in mathematics
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="year">6th Jan 1918
							</span> 	|	He was prone to bouts of depression and suffered from mental illnesses during the later part of his life. His last years were spent in poverty and he spent the final year of his life in a sanatorium.
