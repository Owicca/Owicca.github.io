However, emergency and dynamic situations may require certain steps be conducted out of sequence.</p><ol><li>Identify Critical Information</li></ol><p>Critical information is a specific fact about friendly (that is, non-adversarial) intentions, capabilities, and activities that is needed by adversaries to plan effectively. If Critical Information is obtained, the adversary would be able to cause damage, failure, or otherwise ruin your day.</p><p>In the example above, critical information (or persons, or property, etc) would be access to you.
2. Analyze The Threat</p><p>Once the critical information is identified, the next step is to determine the individuals or groups that represent a threat to that information (or persons, or — okay, okay you get it by now). There may be more than one adversary, and different pieces of information may be targeted by different groups. In this stage, the capabilities, use for the information, determination and resources must also be analyzed.</p><p>Example analysis would be:</p><ol><li>Does the person following me seem threatening? 2) Does it seem like they are smaller or bigger, stronger or weaker, or otherwise are they a physical threat to me? 3) Are they sober? If not, if they were to do something to me, would it be a real threat or something I could just shrug off and keep walking?</li></ol><ol start=3><li>Analyze The Vulnerabilities</li></ol><p>In this phase, the analyst (you) will “Think like the wolf”- that is, they will view their situation from an adversary’s perspective. The vulnerabilities of the organization must be thoroughly explored, especially in terms of physical safeguards, network/electronic safeguards and personnel training.</p><p>In our example above, this is summed up easily as:</p><ol><li>Can I outrun that person if I need to? 2) Am I carrying anything I can&rsquo;t afford to lose? 3) Do I have some device on me that can record the potential altercation for evidence to police (e.g. phone), and if so, would it be destroyed if the phone is destroyed?</li></ol><ol start=4><li>Assess The Risks</li></ol><p>For each vulnerability, the threat must be matched. At this point, each vulnerability is assigned a risk level. This is an unmitigated risk level, meaning that any corrective factors are not included in the analysis. The risk matrix is as follows:</p><p>CRITICAL: An adversary has demonstrated their ability to exploit an existing vulnerability and the resulting impact would be irreparable; hazard consequence would be catastrophic.</p><p>HIGH: There is no doubt an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability and the resulting impact would be serious enough to consider it failure; hazard consequence would be major.</p><p>MEDIUM HIGH: It is probable an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability and the resulting impact would be damaging; hazard consequence would be no higher than major.</p><p>MEDIUM: It is possible an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability and the resulting impact would be manageable; hazard consequence would be no higher than moderate.</p><p>MEDIUM LOW: It is unlikely an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability and the resulting impact would be negligible; hazard consequence would be no higher than minor.</p><p>LOW: It is improbable an adversary would exploit an existing vulnerability and the resulting impact would be insignificant; hazard consequence would be no higher than insignificant.</p><p>The risk level assigned to a vulnerability helps to “triage” the protection.</p><p>Practice this yourself by asking which risk level would be appropriate for the following situations:</p><ol><li><p>The person following you was a large man with blood all over his face, who is carrying a baseball bat and yelling at you.</p></li><li><p>A small child who is running while flying a kite.</p></li><li><p>A tourist using their phone to hail a taxi</p></li><li><p>An abusive ex-girlfriend who you&rsquo;ve moved to another city to get away from</p></li></ol><ol start=5><li>Apply The Countermeasures</li></ol><p>Beginning with high-risk vulnerabilities, a plan is put in place to mitigate the risk factors. All possible countermeasures are considered, and could include additional hardware, training, equipment, or strategies. The most important element of this step is to develop a plan to lower or eliminate the risk, or remove the threat’s access to the resource.</p><p>For the example above, the countermeasure may be simply to walk on the on the other side of the street, to walk by (or inside) the police station, to start jogging, or yell at the person warning them to stop following you and threatening them with a weapon — this should only be done if you have confirmed through Step 2 that it wasn&rsquo;t just a small child running in the street to catch a bus.</p><p>For the above I&rsquo;ve purposely used a non-digital/cybersecurity example because it tends to be easier to comprehend and relate to. Daily threat modeling while online however extends to what information we share, as well as how we connect to the internet.
The takeaway of OpSec is that there is no silver bullet to all situations; that while there are some basic best practices, that&rsquo;s about all they are — basic. Anyone who tries to tell you that you can be secure or private from a single product is selling you security theater.</p><p>Suggesting to someone that they should use Tor without knowing their OpSec threat model could wind them up dead in the wrong country. Suggesting a VPN in China for someone could mean the same, while for someone who wanted to watch NetFlix, even a logging VPN wouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p>As you can see, this makes life a little less paranoid and anxious when we apply critical thought through threat modeling, and teaches us to think for ourselves — which is the ultimate goal in protecting yourself, rather than depending on a single piece of software.</p><p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to working with PrivacyTool.io to build something that raises the bar of discussions and assessments in the community, and brings back the discussions away from &ldquo;how do I stay private?&rdquo; (from whom? should your boss at work not know your name?) and back to &ldquo;How do I maintain my agency of privacy, and what, based on my understood threat model, is best for me in this particular situation?&rdquo; (admittedly it doesn&rsquo;t exactly roll of the tongue, but it&rsquo;s a reproducible and sustainable thought process that actually solves problems rather than creates them).</p><h3 id=2-finding-threats>2. finding threats</h3><h3 id=3-managing-and-addresing-threats>3. managing and addresing threats</h3><h3 id=4-threat-modeling-in-technologies-and-tricky-areas>4. threat modeling in technologies and tricky areas</h3><h3 id=5-taking-it-to-the-next-level>5. taking it to the next level</h3></article><nav class=site-nav><a href=https://www.dinudev.com//>Home</a>
